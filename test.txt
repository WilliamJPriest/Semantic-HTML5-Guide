A list of possible issues

Eventlistener: 

- The onchange event is rerendering on every letter (most likely)
- There mat a typo in the onchange event 

local storage:
- It may have an outdated value in the local storage (most likely)
- check that there aren't no typos or misspellings

JS Api layer:

- check that the fetch request is searching the category section (most likely)
- connected to the correct database

Hello Cameron, 

RE: Recommdations are Down

I have come up with a few possibles reasons why it could down and I beileve that with some guidance you got this.

First, it's most likely an issue the event listener

- check the onchange event function, it should read  setReccomendations(previousRecomedations + reccomedation)
-  compare the useState hook, it should be the same
-  it should start working correctly

docs: 
useState Hook: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html
onchange event: https://upmostly.com/tutorials/react-onchange-events-with-examples

second, less likely but still likely check the local storage

- right click on the webpage,  click inspect and move over to the Storage section
- click on local storage
- compare to you current search term, it should be the same.
- if not look for the localstorage.setItem is saving the correct value.
